Boot Camp# The Programmer Coach
I'm learning programming in C#. I've been on this journey for a little and have really tried to buckle down and hone in my skills to become a programmer.

This is by far the hardest thing I have pushed myself to learn. Growing up I always said I would never become a programmer because I would never understand Zero's and One's. Well that shows my lack of knowledge about programming overall.

Now I'm here learning programming. I've started a family and quickly realized what was once good enough is not anymore. So my motivation and drive comes to provide a life for my family that I hope for them to have.
